# Leon3
The Leon 3 soft core processor is developed by ESA and is maintained in the GRLIB library from the Cobham Gaisler AB. The GRLIB library contains a flexible makefile implementation to rapidly create custom ASICs by selecting modules within the library. Some of these components are IP blocks and are therefore only free-of-charge whenever it is not used commercially.
